				This 2-day conference is approved and funded by the Inter-Institutional Development Scheme (IIDS) project. The IIDS project reference number is UGC/IIDS24/B02/22. The principal investigator of the IIDS project is Dr. Joseph LAU. The IIDS project title is “Building and Sustaining the Momentum of Cross-border Ecommerce for the Greater Bay Area”.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">
				The emergence and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused the stagnation of global economic development, but also, provided a major opportunity for international trade to advance its digital transformation for the rise of e-commerce sales. Indeed, social distancing has determined the growing tendency toward online consumption, and cross-border e-commerce, especially in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), has become an important way to connect manufacturing with global consumption. In response to this opportunity, there is an acute need to quickly adapt to new supply-demand relationships in the GBA, and thus, this proposal will have presenters who already have expertise in cross-border e-commerce businesses in the GBA in China, and the audience comprises individuals who need this digital expertise. The workshops and conference sessions will highlight the issues of cross-border e-commerce businesses in the GBA. These issues may include a balance in the use of innovative technologies and knowledge management, research knowledge and skills, education and training, regulatory and governance techniques and protocols. The conference would be the first of its kind to address such cross-border e-commerce issues.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">
				The project is supported by the School of Professional Education and Executive Development of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU SPEED), Beijing Normal University – Hong Kong Baptist University United International College, Macao Institute for Tourism Studies, Shenzhen University, The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, Change Adaptation Planning for Port, Transportation Infrastructure, and the Arctic, Hong Kong Sea Transport and Logistics Association, and Climate, and Institute of Seatransport.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">
				Through this collaboration, this conference will increase the awareness and support from the industries to share ways to facilitate regional economic development and encourage greater economic integration within the GBA via cross-border e-commerce business development. In response, the conference participants will explore case studies of global companies’ use of e-commerce, with analyses of the use and impact of e-commerce. The participants will also discuss the benefits of e-commerce, the implementation of e-commerce applications, market opportunities and winning strategies of e-commerce.
