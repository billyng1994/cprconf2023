            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">Cross-border e-commerce has seen robust growth in China in recent years. Social distance brought by the pandemic has contributed to the rising trend of online shopping, and cross-border e-commerce, particularly in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), has emerged as a crucial link between domestic production and international demand. To take advantage of this opportunity due to cross-border e-commerce, there is an urgent need to adapt to the new supply-demand relationship, especially in the GBA. In this case, e-commerce is a new combination of productivity, production methods, and production relationships. While China is transforming itself from an industrial-based, export-dependent economy to a service-based, domestic demand-driven one, e-commerce could pose positive impacts in promoting industrial restructuring, boosting domestic demands, increasing employment, and constructing a new order of global trade.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">

			<span>Special issue: Call for Papers: Digital Transformation of Maritime Business</span>
			<br/><br/>
            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">The conventional obstacles to international trade have been lowered as a result of the growth of digitalization during the past two decades. As internet access continues to climb globally and a developing global middle class with discretionary means and a desire for imported goods emerges, soaring demand has been met by increasingly interconnected supply chains and the advent of Digital Transformation of Maritime Business.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">Digital is undoubtedly the way of the future, and the maritime business sector has also started aware of this. While manual systems and human interaction have historically been used in international shipping to move goods to different destinations, the wider trend toward digital business models and process automation is changing the face of global logistics, and technological laggards run the risk of being left behind. Digital transformation becomes more popular in order to cope with the growing e-business, making the maritime business more efficient, cost-saving, and accommodating higher capability.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">There are many different forms and formats of data since there are many distinct aspects of maritime operations and various parties engaged. Digital transformation is the key to ensuring that everyone can quickly access the information is to integrate the data from different locations. As the physical paper is a format that everyone can access, the traditional method is to print everything. However, these days cloud systems have eliminated the necessity for printing. Data uniformity is a frequent goal among port and shipping managers since it is seen to be one of the major obstacles to data integration.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">Digital transformation functions can show benefits instantaneously. Amazon and Alibaba want seamless supply chains from beginning to end, where they would not have to worry about booking things separately onto ships, container loads, and other things like that. They aim for the highest level of automation and technology innovations. Thus, companies invest a lot of money in logistics to strengthen those supply chains. However, they also want supply chains to be as automated as possible since they do not want anything manual or human interaction to obstruct the flow of goods across the world. In the light of this, digitalization transformation for maritime business is the solution to enhance the future maritime business. By developing accessible and simple methods of integrating digital technologies into the everyday operations of the marine business, digitalization transformation is being extended to all levels of labours, not only management and administration.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">This Special Issue of the Maritime Business Review caters for the research gap for all academies to disseminate the knowledge and research findings regarding Digital Transformation for Maritime Business. We welcome articles of high-quality and impactful research on the digital transformation. We take into consideration contributions that present novel and rigorous research techniques to address the issues related to maritime business, as well as associated technical challenges and commerce concepts in current and next-generation maritime business. Articles may use a variety of research techniques, such as case studies, theoretical inquiry, empirical investigations with data analysis, data-driven strategies and project-based field experiences. It is believed that digital transformation is undergoing and more possibilities are waiting to discover. A huge contribution will be shown by the research result.</p>
