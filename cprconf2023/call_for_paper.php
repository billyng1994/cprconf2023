            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">Cross-border e-commerce has seen robust growth in China in recent years. Social distance brought by the pandemic has contributed to the rising trend of online shopping, and cross-border e-commerce, particularly in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), has emerged as a crucial link between domestic production and international demand. To take advantage of this opportunity due to cross-border e-commerce, there is an urgent need to adapt to the new supply-demand relationship, especially in the GBA. In this case, e-commerce is a new combination of productivity, production methods, and production relationships. While China is transforming itself from an industrial-based, export-dependent economy to a service-based, domestic demand-driven one, e-commerce could pose positive impacts in promoting industrial restructuring, boosting domestic demands, increasing employment, and constructing a new order of global trade.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">
            Recognizing such an opportunity, PolyU SPEED, Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, BNU-HKBU United International College, Shenzhen University, Macao Institute for Tourism Studies, Institute of Seatransport, Hong Kong Sea Transport and Logistics Association, and CCAPPTIA (

            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">Many traditional obstacles to international trade have been reduced thanks to the growth of digitalization. As internet access continues to grow and a developing global middle class with discretionary means and a desire for imported goods emerges, such soaring demand has been met by increasingly interconnected supply chains and the advent of Digital Transformation of Maritime Business.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">Indeed, digital is undoubtedly the way of the future, and the maritime business sector has also started to become aware of this. While manual systems and human interaction have historically been used in international shipping, the wider trend toward digital business models and process automation is transforming global logistics, and technological laggards run the risk of being left behind. Digital transformation becomes more popular to cope with the growing e-business, making the maritime business more efficient, cost-saving, and higher capability.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">Moreover, many stakeholders want supply chains to be as automated as possible to minimize manual or human interaction in obstructing cargo flows around the world. In the light of this, digital transformation for maritime business could be the ideal solution to enhance the future maritime business. By developing accessible and simple methods of integrating digital technologies into the daily operations of the maritime business, digitalization is being extended to all levels of labours, not only management and administration.</p>

			<p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">There is a clear need for more research in addressing the digital transformation of the maritime business. Hence, this Special Issue in Maritime Business Review caters to the research gap for all academies to disseminate the knowledge and research findings regarding Digital Transformation for Maritime Business. We welcome articles of high-quality and impactful research on digital transformation. We especially welcome contributions that present novel and rigorous research techniques to address the issues related to maritime business, as well as associated technical challenges and commerce concepts in the current and next-generation maritime business. Articles may employ different research methods, such as case studies, theoretical inquiry, empirical investigations with data analysis, data-driven strategies, and project-based field experiences.</p>
