            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">Cross-border e-commerce has seen robust growth in China in recent years. Social distance brought by the pandemic has contributed to the rising trend of online shopping, and cross-border e-commerce, particularly in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), has emerged as a crucial link between domestic production and international demand. To take advantage of this opportunity due to cross-border e-commerce, there is an urgent need to adapt to the new supply-demand relationship, especially in the GBA. In this case, e-commerce is a new combination of productivity, production methods, and production relationships. While China is transforming itself from an industrial-based, export-dependent economy to a service-based, domestic demand-driven one, e-commerce could pose positive impacts in promoting industrial restructuring, boosting domestic demands, increasing employment, and constructing a new order of global trade.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;color: #000000;">
            Recognizing such an opportunity, PolyU SPEED, Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, BNU-HKBU United International College, Shenzhen University, Macao Institute for Tourism Studies, Institute of Seatransport, Hong Kong Sea Transport and Logistics Association, and CCAPPTIA (
